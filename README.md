# 🛠️ Equipment Log System

This is a simple web application I built using **Flask** and **SQLite** to track equipment details like name, type, and status. I added a basic UI with **HTML/CSS**, and deployed it online using **Render**.

Honestly, I just knew the basics when I started, but I gave my full effort to learn and make it work. It’s not perfect, but it’s mine — and it runs!
